# Recurrent Neural Network

Recurrent neural network is a type of neural network that can be trained to process sequential data. Time series is also a type of sequential data just like natural language data. Thus, RNN can be used in Time series analysis.

First of all, we need to have a glance at the structure of RNN.

The best tutorial for RNN that I can find is [colah's blog](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)
