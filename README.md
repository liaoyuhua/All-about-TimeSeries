# All-about-TimeSeries
Some important topics about Time Series, like predictability, forecasting, clustering, deep learning, etc.

First of all, I want to introduce a general framework for time series tasks called GTA (General Timeseries Analysis). And the code examples and experiments of following contents mostly rely on this framework.

This framework consists of three main parts:
1. TimeSeriesDataSet
2. BaseModel
3. Trainer
Regression, classification, and clustering can be easily implemented and trained by GTA.
